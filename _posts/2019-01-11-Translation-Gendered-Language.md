Following is a beautiful introduction of *Room in New York* by Sheldon Museum of Art[^1] at Lincoln, Nerbraska. 

> Edward Hopper observed the everyday lives of city dwellers in much of his work. In the important canvases painted between 1926 and 1932, he made use of single figures and couples to create a sense of thoughtful reticence and solitude. Eschewing the picturesque and the literal, Hopper’s pictures remain unexplained, without narrative, instead invoking a hermetically sealed world of emotion. In 1935 the artist remarked that the idea for Room in New York was suggested by glimpses of lighted interiors seen as he walked along the city streets at night.
